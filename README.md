1. the [basketball fandom wiki](https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Harrison_Barnes)
   - downside - includes links when players were traded for them
2. normal [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James)
   - downside - includes links when players were traded for them
3. identifying which players were on the same team at the same time (edge if on same team)
   - downside - can't really make communities
